# google-scripts
Google Scripts for automating tasks in Sheets and creating Forms from Sheets. Mostly designed for instructors to use with students. Copy and paste the code into Tools -> Script Editor after creating your Sheet and click Save. Scripts will run directly in Sheets when editing a cell or a new menu item will be added after Help.
